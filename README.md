# Multigit

Multigit (or `mg`) is a Go utility to manage projects composed of
several Git repositories.

Multigit is inspired by [mu-repo](https://github.com/fabioz/mu-repo/),
but is more opinionated and aimed towards very large projects (such as
microservices)

Multigit is currently under early development. Feature requests are welcome!
